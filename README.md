### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. 
I work at Arawa as a trainer, but, when I'm not training, I regularly contribute to Nextcloud and its applications, mainly by reporting bugs, or suggesting functional or UX/UI improvements. I get my hands in the code from time to time to improve the interface design (SCSS/CSS/HTML) via some Pull Requests.
